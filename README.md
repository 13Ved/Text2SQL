# Text2SQL
# Objective
The primary goal of this project is to enable users to query the Sakila database using natural language instead of writing complex SQL commands. By leveraging the **Google Gemini API**, the system generates SQL queries based on user-provided text inputs, thus reducing the barrier to database interaction for non-technical users.

# Algorithm:  
The **Text2Query system** relies on the following process:  
1. **Input Parsing**:  
   - The user enters a natural language query (e.g., *"List the top 5 films by rental count"*).  

2. **Schema Metadata**:  
   - The database schema is loaded (e.g., table names, column names, and relationships) and sent to the API along with the user query to improve query accuracy.  

3. **Google Gemini API**:  
   - The natural language input is sent to the **Google Gemini API**, a state-of-the-art Large Language Model capable of processing structured and unstructured data.  
   - The API processes the input and generates a valid SQL query.  

4. **Output Handling**:  
   - The SQL query generated by the API is returned to the user for execution on the Sakila database.  

# Conclusion 
The Text2Query project showcases the practical application of Large Language Models in simplifying database interactions. By combining natural language processing capabilities of the Google Gemini API with the Sakila database, the system allows users to efficiently explore and analyze data without requiring SQL knowledge. <br>
This approach can be extended to various databases and industries, making it a powerful tool for democratizing access to data analytics.
